# Ad Astra

Ad Astra is an open-source, example-driven encyclopedia created to document concepts in a practical and organized way. The primary goal of this project is to help internalize the concepts we learn through simple, well-documented examples.

Tired of learning concepts that I didn't practice enough and eventually forgot, I created this blog where every new concept I learn will be thoroughly documented, and I'll create simple examples to help internalize them. I strongly believe this is the best way to learn.

While the focus of Ad Astra is on technical subjects, the blog is not limited to technical topics. It is open to any kind of concept from any field, as long as it is well-documented and includes practical examples.

## ðŸŒŸ Contributing

Ad Astra is meant to be open and collaborative. Anyone can contribute, whether by adding posts about new topics or by improving the project itself. If you're an experienced web developer, you'll likely find many areas to enhance the project.

### How to contribute

-   Create a pull request (PR): Fork the repository and create a branch with your changes. Submit a PR with your post or improvements.
    -   Remember to add yourself as a contributor! After adding your content, make sure to include your name in the contributors list located at `src/content/contributors`.
    -   Posts can be about any topic, but must include examples and references to help the community learn through practical applications.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:
