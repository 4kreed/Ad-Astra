                I created Ad Astra, <span class="text-indigo-400/90"
                    >an open-source, example-driven encyclopedia</span
                >
                as part of this journey. Tired of learning concepts that I didn't
                practice enough and eventually forgot, I decided to create this blog
                where, from now on, every new concept I learn will be thoroughly
                documented, and I'll create <span class="text-indigo-400/90"
                    >simple examples</span
                > to help internalize them. I strongly believe this is the best way
                to learn.
            </p>
            <p>
                While the motivation behind creating Ad Astra was to improve the
                way I learn technical subjects, the content of this blog is <span
                    class="text-indigo-400/90"
                    >not limited to technical topics</span
                >. It is open to any kind of concept from any field, as long as
                it is well-documented and includes practical examples.
            </p>
            <p>
                I want this encyclopedia to be <span class="text-indigo-400/90"
                    >open and collaborative</span
                >. Anyone can contribute to it. The best way to do so is to open
                a pull request on GitHub and add a post of any topic with
                examples and references. Don't forget to add yourself as a
                contributor in the list below!
